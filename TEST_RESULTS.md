## Functional source coverage

- Strict single-peer IPv4 WireGuard import and redacted error handling.
- Debian 13 clean-host discovery and refusal of ambiguous/competing ownership.
- Deterministic managed intent, advanced TOML, DNS, route, rule, and IPv6
  ownership planning.
- Bounded numeric all-table routing inspection that treats an absent reserved
  table as clean while refusing populated, malformed, oversized, timed-out,
  permission-denied, or command-failed observations.
- Read-only setup preparation before journal publication; prepared-summary
  journaling at the pre-mutation boundary; no-op preparation, initial-write,
  and incomplete-backup recovery; verified backup; temporary guard; safe
  apply; commit; boot activation; idempotent rerun; and exact later rollback.
- Strict local Docker bridge discovery; semantic daemon JSON ownership;
  eligible empty custom-network support; running/retained/changing workload
  refusal; post-plan clean-state revalidation; container-zone/VPN-only policy;
  NFTFW-owned IPv4 forwarding; confirmed restart only when required;
  topology/route revalidation; and exact rollback.
- Stable Docker authorization provenance across a race-consistent full-ID and
  Linux-bridge rebind, including transactional generation publication.
- Exact v2.0.3 static advanced Docker compatibility: unchanged bridge/tuple,
  historical interface-name provenance, ledger ID, and configuration bytes;
  strict isolation from managed dynamic `docker:<network>` rebinding; mixed
  static/dynamic operation; and non-mutating mismatch refusal.
- Explicit dry-run-only existing-host adoption planning with exact schema-6
  state/pointer/snapshot/provenance and live-policy fingerprint verification,
  double observation,
  deterministic redacted output, actionable refusals, and byte-identical
  no-mutation fixture proof.
- Managed `expose` and `lan` changes compiled from the newly published
  protected files rather than stale daemon memory.
- Checksummed managed-change journal recovery for pre-apply, applied,
  prepared, rolled-back, and uncertain committed states.
- Structured operator backup including state, provenance, intent, VPN,
  enforcement pointer, and immutable generation artifacts.
- Managed status/dashboard projection and fail-closed status-v2 consumers.
- Package nonactivation, unit ownership, candidate quarantine, and release
  evidence separation.
- Security-sensitive mode-refusal fixtures set and verify their intended mode;
  an isolated `umask 0077` regression proves mode-`0600` handling and explicit
  mode-`0644` refusal without changing the runtime helper.

## Performance source results

The repeated 10-sample source matrix remained inside the Amendment E budgets
on the reference NUC. Observed maxima included 0.004406 ms provider parsing,
0.015499 ms managed Docker config generation, 0.029768 ms strict daemon merge,
0.012429 ms Docker topology projection, 0.006718 ms managed route decoding,
0.001378 ms Docker workload-ID classification, 0.063440 ms standard
compilation, 32.904408 ms 10,000-policy compilation, 0.019690 ms canonical
fingerprinting, 0.350305 ms no-op reconciliation, 0.0003042 ms dashboard status
projection, and 0.001879 ms adoption worksheet generation. No measured
operation regressed by more than 10% from the prior recorded matrix.
Performance evidence is not privileged network proof.

## Not executed under Stage E-R

The latest approval-bound E-R2 attempt passed its preceding disposable gates
and reached the managed first-setup scenario. It then hard-stopped because the
engine published its journal before clean-host discovery; discovery correctly
classified that journal as existing NFTFW state, and rollback had no prepared
plan. That partial run is not complete privileged acceptance evidence. A
renewed E-R2 run has not been executed and requires new approval bound to the
replacement frozen source and candidate comparison.

Privileged scripts mutate disposable network, package, Docker, or boot state.
They require the separately identity-bound Stage E-R2 approval.
